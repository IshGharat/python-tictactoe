# python-tictactoe
I created a python Tic Tac Toe game. The first game is played directly in the terminal. It's simple and fun. I then added graphics using the pygame library.

Just run any of the files.
In the CLI version, both the players enter the row and column of the 3x3 grid to play the game.
